          <p class="about-item-text">Started as a Jr. front-end developer on Apr. 2016. Learned a lot and became a front-end developer in December 2016. The opportunities kept appearing and I started leading the front-end in January of 2018. Now I'm managing the front-end team while working as the leading front end developer until this date.</p>
          <p class="about-item-text">I started freelancing in 2016 to test my skills and since then have been working on side jobs from time to time.</p>
          <p class="about-item-text">When I graduated, I started working for a short period at Dism√°quinas, on Frederico Westphalen, then I moved to Santana do Livramento for a while, and work at Genesysinf on the Sageweb project, before leaving to Porto Alegre.</p>

I'm learning Angular and React, looking for opportunities to apply the new knowledge, and some Python.</p>
